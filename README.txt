in order to start this program
in the console 
-> cd C:Users\....\backend
or wherever you have this project downloaded to
 then
 -> node server.js
 should work
 or
 -> nodemon server.js
 just need to make sure you have nodemon installed

 if you want to access a collection such as: Users, Stats, Workouts
 please create a schema that is similar to the one i have already created for Stats
